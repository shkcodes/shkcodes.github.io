Hey, I am Shashank! 👋🏼

I am an Android developer at [Fueled](https://fueled.com/). I love creating enjoyable user experiences using the magic of 0s and 1s. Kotlin and Material Design are ❤️.
I challenge you to name a better duo than music and coding.

My love affair with Android started in college when I developed [Instadict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shkmishra.instadict&hl=en_IN), which is my most notable project till date, with over a 100k downloads.

In my free time, I love to game and read books, with my favorites being Rocket League, The Witcher Series and The Mistborn Series.
